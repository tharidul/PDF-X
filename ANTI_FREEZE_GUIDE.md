# PDF-X Anti-Freeze Performance Guide

## Problem: PC Freezing During PDF Preview Loading

When processing large PDF files (especially 200+ pages), the PDF-X application could cause your PC to freeze due to excessive memory usage and CPU-intensive operations.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Smart Memory Management

**Memory Pressure Detection:**
- Real-time monitoring of browser memory usage
- Automatic detection when memory usage exceeds 85% of available heap
- Dynamic adjustment of processing parameters based on memory availability

**Adaptive Processing:**
- Smaller thumbnail sizes (150x210 instead of 200x280) under memory pressure
- Lower image quality (JPEG with 60% quality instead of PNG with 80%)
- Reduced batch sizes for thumbnail generation
- Automatic garbage collection triggers

### 2. Progressive Loading Strategy

**Limited Thumbnail Generation:**
- Large files (>50MB): Maximum 50 thumbnails instead of 100
- Very large files (>100MB) with many pages: User confirmation required
- Summary cards for remaining pages instead of generating all thumbnails

**Batch Processing Improvements:**
- Adaptive batch sizes: 1-3 thumbnails per batch based on memory pressure
- Increased delays between batches for large files (100-500ms)
- Memory cleanup between batches

### 3. PDF.js Optimizations

**Rendering Options:**
```typescript
{
  disableStream: true,        // Better memory management
  disableAutoFetch: true,     // Prevent prefetching
  disableFontFace: true,      // Reduce font overhead
  cMapPacked: true,           // Better performance
  useSystemFonts: true,       // Use system fonts
  renderInteractiveForms: false, // Skip form rendering
  intent: 'print'            // Optimized rendering
}
```

### 4. User Warnings and Controls

**Large File Warnings:**
- Automatic warnings for files >100MB with >50 pages
- User confirmation before processing very large files
- Clear file size and page count information

**Memory Status Display:**
- Real-time memory usage warnings
- Visual indicators when memory pressure is detected
- Recommendations to close other tabs/applications

### 5. File Processing Limits

**Size Restrictions:**
- Maximum file size: 100MB per file
- Warning for batch uploads >10 files
- Confirmation dialogs for potentially problematic operations

**Processing Safeguards:**
- Cancellation support for long-running operations
- Automatic cleanup when switching between tools
- Memory pressure checks before each operation

## Performance Benefits

### Before Improvements:
- ❌ Large PDFs could freeze the entire PC
- ❌ No memory usage awareness
- ❌ Fixed batch sizes regardless of system capabilities
- ❌ No user warnings for problematic files
- ❌ PNG thumbnails with high memory usage

### After Improvements:
- ✅ Graceful handling of large files without freezing
- ✅ Dynamic adjustment based on system memory
- ✅ User warnings and confirmations for risky operations
- ✅ Progressive loading with visual feedback
- ✅ JPEG thumbnails with optimized compression

## Usage Recommendations

### For Best Performance:

1. **Close Unnecessary Browser Tabs**
   - Other tabs consume memory that PDF-X could use
   - The memory warning will alert you when this is needed

2. **Process Large Files in Smaller Chunks**
   - Instead of extracting 500 pages at once, do 100-200 pages per operation
   - This prevents memory exhaustion

3. **Use Appropriate File Sizes**
   - Files under 50MB process smoothly
   - Files 50-100MB may show warnings but work
   - Files over 100MB are blocked for safety

4. **Monitor Memory Warnings**
   - Yellow warning bar appears when memory usage is high
   - Follow the recommendations to close other applications

### Troubleshooting:

**If you still experience slowness:**
1. Refresh the page to clear memory
2. Close other browser tabs and applications
3. Try processing fewer pages at once
4. Use smaller PDF files when possible

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Best performance in Chrome/Edge (memory API support)
- Firefox and Safari work but without memory monitoring
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified:
- `PDFSplitter.tsx` - Enhanced with memory management
- `PDFRemover.tsx` - Added memory pressure detection
- `PDFMerger.tsx` - Improved thumbnail generation
- `memoryManagement.ts` - Core memory utilities
- `useMemoryMonitor.ts` - Memory monitoring hook
- `MemoryWarning.tsx` - User feedback component

### Memory Management Functions:
- `isMemoryPressure()` - Detects high memory usage
- `triggerGarbageCollection()` - Forces cleanup when available
- `getMemoryUsage()` - Returns current memory statistics
- `formatMemorySize()` - Human-readable memory formatting

This comprehensive approach ensures that PDF-X can handle large files efficiently without freezing your PC, while providing clear feedback about system performance and memory usage.
